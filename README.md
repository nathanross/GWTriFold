# GWTriFold

## About

GWTriFold is a GWT wrapper for easy use and configuration of the TriFold layout engine. GWT + GWTriFold is the perfect environment for getting simple, responsive web apps up and running in days, not weeks. 

# Using GWTriFold

The best way to download and use GWTriFold is through the GWTriFold demo. Download it directly here (with default configuration), or try out the configuration options on the TriFold configdemo website and then download a configured version.

The Sample App also contains a copy of the documentation.

## Building

### Build requirements

1. jdk
2. ant
3. gwt

environment variable GWTHOME must be set to the root GWT dir

### Build instructions

call "ant jar" within the GWTriFold root directory.

For details about the various build directives, see the build.xml file.

## SampleApp

A SampleApp folder is included in this repository. Note however, that the SampleApp folder does not come with a GWTriFold jar within it. You can download a SampleApp (using a default configuration) directly here=

The SampleApp is designed to be as similar as possible as the default SampleApp for eclipse with the GWT plugin.

This is because GWT developers who plan to build without eclipse and would like a more sparse project folder or a complex ant file will generally know how to accomplish that. 

But users just getting started with GWT (and unfamiliar with Ant) will be unfamiliar with how to adapt a sparse project folder for Eclipse's use.
